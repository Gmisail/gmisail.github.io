## News, I guess?

Hello. Today I was doing some experimentation with LibGDX, especially with my WIP game engine Atomic. I was experimenting with tile maps and collisions, which are really the worst. Well, collision anyway. I am making a mini-project, sort of a RPG, just to build on Atomic and get some juicy experience.

## Atomic?
Atomic is my personal WIP game engine. It is based on LibGDX and Java, and supports desktop, ios, android, and HTML. I would distribute it, but I need to get the project structure sorted out first. 

## Ewww, Java
Deal with it, Java is good.
