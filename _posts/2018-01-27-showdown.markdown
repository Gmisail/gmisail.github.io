Showdown has been an off-and-on project for several years. It is a local multiplayer game where you must kill your enemy.

It is written in Haxe using Haxeflixel. Levels use CSV files which are drawn using Tiled. The level data and player data is written using JSON files. In the standalone version, you can edit these files to modify the game.

Because OpenFL's HTML5 output is not the best, there will be a few issues. For instance, the fonts are fuzzy and audio does not work. These issues are fixed on the desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux) version.

**Milestones:**
- [X] 1v1 PVP
- [X] Weapons
- [ ] More Levels
- [ ] Scripting (hscript? custom scripting lang?)
- [ ] Multiplayer
- [ ] LAN Multiplayer
- [ ] Release on Itch.io
- [X] Release on Gamejolt
- [X] Compile for HTML5
- [X] Compile for Mac
- [ ] Compile for Windows
- [ ] Compile for Linux

I plan completing at least the first 3 for the initial beta release. Scripting will allow the user to create mods and edit the player. Multiplayer will be the trickiest task, and probably the last to be completed.
