Ok, first of all, you're probably like *AHHH WHERE ARE THE GAMES!?!?!* Don't worry, they're here. To go to Dinosaurs with Laser Guns, use this url: ```www.gmisail64.github.io/projects/dwlg``` and for Starro, use this ```www.gmisail64.github.io/projects/Starro```.

### What Happened?

I have entered the 21st century. My old website layout was in HTML/CSS with Twitter Bootstrap. I mean that is fine and all but... ew... HTML. What is a great work around? Enter Jekyll. Jekyll is a relatively new platform that uses a markdown language and generates HTML. Pretty neat, eh?

I honestly have better things to do, than to use HTML. Jekyll has got me covered. Plus it works with Github Pages, which is what I use. :)
