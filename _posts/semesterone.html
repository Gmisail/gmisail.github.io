				<h4 class="color" id="title">Semester One</h4>
					<p>2 / 5 / 2020 </p>
				<p><p>I think that it is safe to say that I have become the person that I have sworn to destroy. Prior to 
this semester, when I had an idea that I wanted to program, my go-to stack was usually one of the following:</p><ul><li>React &amp; Javascript</li><li>Node.js &amp; Javascript</li><li>Haxe</li><li>Python</li></ul>
<p>Machine code almost never crossed my mind. By machine code, I mean languages that are actually compiled
into machine code, like C, C++, and Rust. At the time, these languages were just relics from the past.</p>
<p><em>"Why would I need to use C or C++ when I can prototype so quickly in Javascript? Besides, the syntax doesn't make sense. 
Why do I need to delete variables, anyways?"</em>  - Me, probably</p>
<p>After a grueling four months of LLDB'ing and Valgrind'ing, using managed programming languages does not feel the same. Sure,
who can resist the simplicity of languages like Python and Javascript? I mean, </p>
<p><code>var myarray = []</code></p>
<p>... is so much easier than,</p>
<p><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; myarray;</code></p>
<p>The only problem is, when using languages like Javascript, I can almost <em>feel</em> the inefficiency. I found myself asking <em>node</em>,</p>
<p><em>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY MEMORY?? WHAT IF I WANT TO PASS BY REFERENCE INSTEAD OF A COPY?"</em> - Also me, probably</p>
<p>The issue that I am having is that after writing low-level, memory efficient code for so long, going back to
these managed environments feels almost foreign. Do I realize how truly great they are now? Of course! Would I
use them for everything still? Heck no. It has come to the point, however, that when I am ready to start a new
project, instead of cracking open trusty Node.js, I find myself opening up CLion and creating a new C++ project. If 
I were face-to-face with my old self, I would have to slap myself out of the trance that is manual memory management.
Unfortunately for my past self, I am too far gone. </p>
<p>Honestly, it is not horrible. To be completely honest, I enjoy the challenge that it has presented. After suffering
through it for a semester, you start to see C / C++ as a manual transmission sports car; you have complete control of everything.
You can either rev the engine to <em>totally</em> impress your high school friends, or you can stall out in the midst
of segmentation faults. </p>
<p>After being in C++ land, you also start to figure out how managed programming languages actually work internally. Concepts
like garbage collection make so much more sense once you've written a couple thousand lines of C / C++ code. </p>
<p>I never thought that I would consider myself a "C++ programmer." As someone who felt at home with web development, 
writing low level code was never <em>really</em> a consideration. However, those many of months of suffering have paid off in my
mind. There are so many programming languages that I would love to know and / or master. Even though I am by no means a C++ guru,
knowing the language opens up many doors into lower level programming. </p>
<p>As Semester 1 comes to a close, I am excited to see what is next and what material is on deck to be thrown at me. I
made it out alive in Level 1, hopefully I will have similar luck as I traverse into the unknowns of Level 2.</p></p>
