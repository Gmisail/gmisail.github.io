<p>
So, as of right now, two months have gone by since summer vacation finally began. Even though it hasn't been too
exciting in particular, I've killed some major bugs and learned a lot.
</p>

<h4>Nice</h4>

<p>
First of all, I've made some big changes in my Nice project, a static site generator. Although the core generator remained untouched (I do not think I have had to wait more than a second for my websites to generate, and at this point I am scared to change anything) 
I have made the overall workflow way easier. I updated the documentation on the GitHub README, and added a couple commands (create-post, create-page, create-layout) that create basic data-types and fill in the essentials. 
</p>

<p>
When I first developed Nice, the overall project creation process was kinda sluggish. There were tons of folders to create, files to fill in, and tears. Thankfully, I developed a handy
command (create) that generates a complete project that provides and easy starting point for new blogs, documentation, and general websites. 
</p>

<p>
This project was aimed at developers that want to generate static websites quickly, while also being able to access the web technologies that they love. I believe that this project nails
that goal pretty well, and honestly I am very proud of it. 
</p>

<h4>Other Projects</h4>

<p>
I have not been as productive as I wanted this summer, mostly because of my job and having a lack of original ideas. I have an issue when it comes to developing
software; it needs to be innovative and new. Of course, these ideas are difficult to come by. However, in my search of creativity, I have developed many small projects that
have helped me master Node.js (Express) and React. Although none of these little apps will become the next AirBNB or Netflix, they helped me strengthen my knowledge of full stack development.
It's not about the destination, it's about the journey, right?
