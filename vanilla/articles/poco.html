                        The Poco Virtual Machine is a tiny virtual machine written in Javascript. It runs a hexadecimal-like language, called Pocobyte.
                        The language lacks variable types, if statements, and many features of a C-like language. The language is not based on English terms, and instead uses only characters and numbers.

                        <p>
                            Pocobyte is very difficult to understand. But like most languages, it comes with practice. Below is an example, with explanations.

                            <p>
                                <code>
                                    0x000
                                    <br>
                                    3x01a
                                    <br>
                                    3x01b
                                    <br>
                                    1x000
                                    <br>
                                </code>

                                <br>

                                0 is the screen program in the PocoVM. The function 000 within the screen program clears the screen. The 'x' divides the program and function names.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                3 is the memory program. In order to set variables in the memory, you need to access the memory program. The first two values in the program name, 0 and 1, represent the value you are sending into memory. So in the first instance of the 3 program, 3x01a, you are pushing the value of 1 (or 01) into memory. The last value, a, represents which buffer you are storing it in. Each buffer stores one value, however can be reassigned.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The next line is the same as the previous, except we are storing the value 1 in the b buffer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                1 is the pixel program, or the program for manipulating pixels. The function 000 is used to set pixels. The function uses the a and b buffers for the x and y positions. Therefore, since we set 1 to the a buffer and 1 to the b buffer, it will print a pixel at (1, 1)
                            </p>

                            The PocoVM is still in current development. The project's goals are to increase speed, and increase functions.
